mcxNOW C# API SDK
=================

This kit is for developing whatever you want for [mcxNOW.com](http://mcxnow.com) cryptocoin exchange in C#. *We both know it will be bot. Right?*

**Same rules and limits were implemented as for web user, going behind those limits and against them is only on you.**

**This is product of cryptocoin enthusiast and mcxNOW fan and member since early days and should be treated as such.** *Ask kindly.*

This SDK is not endorsed paid or developed from or by mcxNOW Exchange owner nor staff.

Due to ever evolving nature of mcxNOW Exchange this SDK or its parts might deprecate rather quickly. *Managing to keep up so far.*

There is no guarantee that everything will work and I can't be held accountable for your losses from trading or due to bug.

All this said this SDK was tested for 3 days before its official release and know bugs were eliminated.

**Known Issues:**

* Reading chat messages is not working (due to RESTSharp limitations)

Any pull request are welcome and if will be of decent quality merged will eventually occur.
